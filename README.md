# Car Price Prediction
In my project, I aimed to predict car prices using machine learning techniques. I collected a dataset containing various features of cars such as manufacturer, model, mileage, engine volume, and more. After preprocessing the data to handle missing values and encode categorical variables, I explored different regression models including Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and Ridge Regression. I used cross-validation to tune the hyperparameters of the models and evaluated their performance using metrics like RMSE and R-squared. The Lasso Regression model, in particular, stood out for its ability to handle feature selection and regularization. I deployed the trained Lasso Regression model as an API endpoint using Plumber, allowing users to make predictions on new car data. Overall, this project demonstrates my application of machine learning in predicting car prices and provides a practical tool for pricing cars based on their attributes.
